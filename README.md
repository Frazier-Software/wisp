<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

- Light as a feather at ~500 lines & built with mobile in mind.
- Styles designed to be a starting point, not a UI framework.
- Quick to start with zero compiling or installing necessary.

You should use Wisp if you're embarking on a smaller project or just don't feel like you need all
the utility of larger frameworks. Wisp only styles a handful of standard HTML elements, but that's
often more than enough to get started.

## Acknowledgments

This project started as a fork of a CSS boilerplate by [Dave Gamache][dave-url]. I wanted to update some of
the base classes, remove some of the obsolete cruft, and add a few common web UI components that I thought
warranted an inclusion. The original project was named Skeleton, but due to the rising popularity of the
similarly named [Skeleton][skeleton-url] svelte toolkit, I decided a re-branding was also in order.

Thank you Dave for all the hard work. The original version of Skeleton was useful for a ton of old projects
and customer sites. Hopefully someone enjoys this refreshed edition as much as I enjoyed the original.
